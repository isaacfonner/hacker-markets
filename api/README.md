# Hacker Market API

The API for Hacker Market, built using Elysia and Bun.

To run this API, simply run `bun run dev`. (last to specify this is a monorepo and Bun will need to look for the env var somewhere else). It will run on port 3101. Please change it in the environment variables if you need to.

Instructions for environment variables can be found in the `bot` directory.
